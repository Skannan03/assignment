# """Python Conditions and If statements
# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
#
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b"""
# a = 200
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#   print("a and b are equal")
# else:
#   print("a is greater than b")
#
# a = 200
# b = 33
# c = 500
# if a > b and c > a:
#   print("Both conditions are True")
#
# # WHILE LOOP
# while True:

# Try Except
# The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
